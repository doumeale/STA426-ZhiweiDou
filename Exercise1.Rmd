```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. The following section genarte 100 values from a log-normal distribution where
$\mu$ = 1, $\sigma$ = 0.25.

```{r , echo = TRUE}
set.seed(2020)
sample <- rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```

2. The following two plots show the histogram of the distribution and the histogram of the distribution on the log scale. 

```{r , echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(sample, main = "Distribution of the sample")
hist(log(sample), main = "Distribution of the sample on the log scale", cex.main = 0.8)
```

3. In the end, we can calculate using R:
```{r}
mean <- mean(sample)
variance <- var(sample)
```
The mean of the samples is 2.90 and the variance is 0.68.
